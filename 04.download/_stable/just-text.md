## The 10+ years old stable Scribus

Scribus 1.4.8 is the latest stable release.

It's more than 10 years old and you should probably not install or use it anymore. It's also the last one in the 1.4.x series.

To download it, choose one of the options belowâ€¦

You can get and compile yourself 1.4.9svn but there is no plan to ever release 1.4.9.

If you need anything that is not in 1.4.x you're welcome to try and use the development version 1.5.x until the next stable 1.6 is released.
