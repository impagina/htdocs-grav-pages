In some distributions, Scribus 1.5.5 (or 1.5.6svn) can be obtained from your package manager as "scribus-ng".

In some distributions, Scribus 1.5.5 is packaged as "scribus" and there is no stable version:

- Gentoo,
- Arch.

For Ubuntu a [PPA is available](https://launchpad.net/~scribus/+archive/ppa?target=_blank)

For the documentation, you will probably need to activate the "Non Free" Repository.
