## Catching up with the times<a id="development"></a>

For many years now, the development version of Scribus has been the one that most people will recommend you to use.

The current development version is said to be on its way to become the new stable version 1.6 but it will probably take some time before a new stable version gets released.

## Cutting Edge Development Version<a id="development"></a>

Use unstable versions only for testing and NOT in production mode.
Unstable developer snapshots can corrupt files of stable versions and can make them unusable.
